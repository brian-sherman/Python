'''
Program to print all 2-letter domain names.
Note that ord() and chr() convert between text and ASCII/ Unicode encodings.
ord('a') is 97. ord('b') is 98, and so on. chr(99) is 'c', etc.

print('Two-letter domain names:')

letter1 = 'a'
letter2 = '?'
while letter1 <= 'z':  # Outer loop
    letter2 = 'a'
    while letter2 <= 'z':  # Inner loop
        print('%s%s.com' % (letter1, letter2))
        letter2 = chr(ord(letter2) + 1)
    letter1 = chr(ord(letter1) + 1)

Modify the program to include two-character .com names, 
where the second character can be a letter or a number, e.g., a2.com. 
Hint: Add a second while loop nested in the outer loop, 
but following the first inner loop, that iterates through the numbers 0-9.
