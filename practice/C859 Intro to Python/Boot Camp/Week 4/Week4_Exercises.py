Modules
1.  Importing Modules Example:

Write a Python program that import functions from library modules.

example output:  11/18/2020

"""



"""
2.  Using From Example:

Write a function where you find the days and weeks between 2 random datetime objects?

"""



"""
3.  Script Example:

if __name__ == "__main__":

There is no "main" function in python. There is a reserved variable "__name__" in python. 
When you run your script, the __name__ variable equals __main__. When you import the containing script, 
it will contain the name of the script.

"""



"""
4.  Common Standard Libary Example

datetime, random, math, os, sys

"""



"""
5.  Third-party Libraries Example

Pandas, NumPy

Problem 1

Given the following piece of code

aList = list('HelloHello World')

anIntArray = np.arange(16)

aDict = dict(zip(aList, anIntArray))

Convert the given list, numpy array, and dictionary into Pandas series.

Problem 2

Given the following piece of code to create a NumPy array,

anIntArray: anIntArray = np.random.randint(1, 10, 36)

Add Python code to convert this array into a Pandas series and then find the positions of numbers that are 
multiples of 3 from the series.

6.  Reading Files Example

Write a function named ReadFile(no arguments) to read a file (it gets the name by asking user via the input() 
function). It will read all the lines in the file as a list of strings and count of how many lines are in it. 
Finally it will return the aforementioned list of strings. 

"""


"""
7.  Grabbing Contents from File Example

    From the program above, do the following:
        A.  Display the contents of the file.
        B.  Strip out all punctuation and count the total number of characters.
        C.  Count the total number of words.
        D.  Add up the total length of all the words and calculate the average word length.
        E.  Display the values you calculated in all the steps A, B, and C.

"""
8.  Writing Files Example:

Write the function that reads a file called "file.txt". It then writes into another file called “newFile.txt”.  
All of the words becomes uppercase in the file “newFile.txt”.

"""




"""
8a.  Writing Files Example using os import:

Write a program that adds an item to an existing file.

Write a program that asks the user for a file containing a list of items to be completed and a name for an output file. 
Your program should then write the list, with item numbers to the output file. 

For example, if the input file is:
    Finish my python homework.
    Buy milk.
    Do laundry.
    Update webpage.

Then the output file would be:
    1.  Finish my python homework.
    2.  Buy milk.
    3.  Do laundry.
    4.  Update webpage.
